# A-Neural-Network-Approach-to-the-Environmental-Kuznets-Curve
Python code and data used to reproduce the main results of the paper *A Neural Network Approach to the Environmental Kuznets Curve* by Mikkel Bennedsen, Eric Hillebrand, and Sebastian Jensen, 2023.

The code is built with python 3.x (tested with version 3.6.10) and TensorFlow 2.x (tested with version 2.2.0).

## Project status
Work in progress.


## Installation
Not yet available through the Python Package Index (PyPi).


## Usage
Save this repository locally (e.g. using Github Desktop), and make sure to have installed all required dependencies. 

The ***Papers*** folder contains the data and source code needed to reproduce all results of the two reference papers.

The ***Functions*** folder contains custom functions used for data preparation and implementation of the neural network-based panel data methodology: 

* The source code for the static neural network model is available in _Static_NN_model.py_.

* The source code for the dynamic neural network model is available in _Dyanmic_NN_model.py_.

 * The source code for the path-dependent neural network model is available in _Path_dependent_NN_model.py_.
